**Top Priority (most urgent)**
- **Include more information needed**

High Priority
- (Wokring) Investigate whether most of adversarial samples fall into the same provenance. If it is the case, maybe we can remove the provenance where adversarial samples are potential to match -> draw a graph to demonstrate the result
- Consider leverage the concept of conditional probability 
- Try One-class SVM (OSVM)
- Experiment on widely-adopted models 

Low Priority
- Unify the format of citations
- Enlarge the table to include 0qr(min)/1qr/2qr(medium)/3qr/4qr(max)
- Document down the model architectures
