**Top Priority (most urgent)** <br/>
PropogationPattern-based RNN Detection -> PPRD
- Try to test whether i_FGSM can generalize to the same type of attack under PPRD 
- Try to solve the problem (simple PPRD approach can not generalize to other types of attacks, like l2 can not generalize to l0)
- Try to open another section in README called PPRD 

Others 
- Try One-class SVM (OSVM)
- Experiment on widely-adopted models 
- Unify the format of citations
