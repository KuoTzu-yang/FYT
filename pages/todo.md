**Top Priority (most urgent)** <br/>
PropogationPattern-based RNN Detection -> PPRD
- Genereate sufficient singatures of adv samples for later re-usage (use adv attacks with high ASR among 14 adv attacks)
- Try to test whether PPRD can generate in the same type 
- Try to test whether PPRD can generate among different types (l1, l2, linf, etc)

Others 
- Try One-class SVM (OSVM)
- Experiment on widely-adopted models 
- Unify the format of citations
