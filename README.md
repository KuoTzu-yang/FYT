### Research Questions (RQs)

#### RQ1: As a developer, given the training dataset, can we design a metric to efficiently approximate the adversarial robustness?  

(Talk about the inspiration about relevant work) 
1. Dimensionality 
2. Distance to decision boundary (in various directions like benign, adversarial, random)
3. Non-robust features 
4. Some theorectical metrics (e.g., local intrinsic dimensionality, adversarial risk by concentration of measure [])

(Description the mathmatical formula here)

##### RQ1.1, (non-multimeida dataset, self-constructed 2-dimensional inputs)
